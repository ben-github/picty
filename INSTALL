Installing phraymd on a Linux-based System
==========================================

Dependencies
============

python(>=2.5)
python-gtk2
python-gnome2
python-pyinotify
python-pyexiv2

recommended packages: dcraw, totem, python-gdata, python-flickrapi, python-osmgpsmap


Create and Install a Debian Package
===================================

To create the package run as root:

cd <phraymd src dir>
dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot

To install, run as root:

dpkg -i ../phraymd*.deb

Installing using your package manager
=====================================

You can also use checkinstall to create a package that is compatible with many
linux package management systems (for example, RPM, Deb)

(Make sure you do not already have phraymd installed into the system folders before running these steps)

Run the following as root:

checkinstall --pkgversion=0.2 --maintainer="joebloggs@freesoftware" \
    --pkgname=phraymd \
    ./setup.py install --home=/usr  \
    --install-purelib=/usr/share/phraymd

You will prompted to supply additional information.

This will create and install the package. You will be able to remove the
package using standard tools

Installing without a package manager
====================================

Run the following as root

sudo ./setup.py install --no-compile --home=debian/phraymd/usr \
    --install-purelib=debian/phraymd/usr/share/phraymd

Note that installing in this way provides no mechanism for
uninstalling.
