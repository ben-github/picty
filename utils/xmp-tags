DerivedFrom 	Derived From 	ResourceRef 	XmpText 	Internal 	A reference to the original document from which this one is derived. It is a minimal reference; missing components can be assumed to be unchanged. For example, a new version might only need to specify the instance ID and version number of the previous version, or a rendition might only need to specify the instance ID and rendition class of the original.
DocumentID 	Document ID 	URI 	XmpText 	Internal 	The common identifier for all versions and renditions of a document. It should be based on a UUID; see Document and Instance IDs below.
History 	History 	seq ResourceEvent 	XmpText 	Internal 	An ordered array of high-level user actions that resulted in this resource. It is intended to give human readers a general indication of the steps taken to make the changes from the previous version to this one.
