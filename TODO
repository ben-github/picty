Project todo list
=================

DISCLAIMER: I expect this document will regularly get out of date.
Nonetheless, the idea is to keep track of short-term plans (2-3 months).
As stuff is completed or plans change the list should be updated.

* Rename import plugin Transfer (andpossibly drop the upload plugin)
* Transfer plugin should get preference widgets from collections (e.g. specify import location, metadata handling, privacy etc)
* All collections should have an offline member and when offline turn off GUI that needs read or write access to the store
* The OSD delete button becomes a toggle. Delete is committed along with metadata changes (requires the collection to be online)
* Each collection should specify the metadata that is editable and/or provide the editing widgets
* Support GEO (GPS) info in flickr
* More customization of thumbnailing options
    * Delete thumbnails when image is deleted (add option to scan and delete redundant thumbnails)
    * Copy cached thumbnails on transfer (avoids downloading/recreating)
* Drag to/from desktop or other apps needs more support
* Correctly count the number of flickr items during FlickrSync
* Add options to scan for updates or fully reimport the collection
* Logging pane in the Transfer plugin
* Don't allow duplicates of a tag in an image
* Collections need icons on the start page

* Move collection handling (scanning/updating/filter/operations) to a separate process
  * Client/Server model
    * GUI = client, requests images from server
    * Server maintains the index and datastore of underlying images in a collection
    * Server process watches for changes to images and updates index/datastore appropriately, notifying GUI and getting user feedback as necessary
    * Optional "always on" server (tracks all changes to images in monitored
      collections even while phraymd client is not running)
  * This is hard because...
    * Passing data between processes is slow
    * High priority tasks need to interrupt with low latency
    * Have to keep many "lists" of images:
      * Master list: server side, keeps track of: uid, metadata, thumbnail info, full image
      * View: list known to both server and client, each item in the view is a tuple of (sortkey,uid)

* Overhaul image class, metadata and image handling
  * track file attributes (file size, image dimensions, mtime, presence of thumbnails)
  * mimetype/store specific handler for metadata read/write and image processing
  * must be able to handle cloud-based collections
  * lossless image manipulation options (keep record of changes, and a cached version
    of the altered image)
  * support for XMP sidecars (for images that don't support metadata read/write)

* Update the browser
    * be more consistent with user theme (colors, look and feel)
    * size and align text better
    * improve keyboard navigation

* General UI
  * Padding and alignment tweaks to most of the dialog areas
  * Keyboard customization
  * Progress bar too distracting, messages don't always disapper (e.g. job cancelled)
    and messages not always useful

* Image viewer enhancements
  * Implement the image viewer as a gtk.Container that can dynamically place/size/hide gtk widgets
    * Example use: when mouse over right side of image show a zoom slider and combo box
  * Keyboard toggles for displaying toolbar and

* Plugins
  * New plugins
    * Loupe tool in the image viewer
    * Histogram
    * Exposure tweaks
  * More flexible camera import (folder naming scheme)
  * Managing Sets/Albums for flickr/picasa uploads

* Overhaul thumbnail support (e.g. allow user to store thumbs in custom
    cache location, support tumbler, use embedded image thumbnails and
    fallback to manual creation as necessary)
