Project todo list
=================

* DISCLAIMER: I expect this document will regularly get out of date
* Nonetheless, the idea is to keep track of short-term plans (2-3 months)
* As stuff is completed or plans change the list should be updated
* This file will be in source control to keep track of its history

* Update to pyexiv2, support XML (embedded in image and sidecars)
* Update the browser -- in particular improve the image overlay by
    * darkening background thumbnail
    * color the overlay area (a frame around the image)
    * use visual hints when hovering over buttons
    * make the text customizable (e.g. ability to show full path)
    * size and align text better
* Padding and alignment tweaks to most of the dialog areas
* Progress bar messages don't always disapper (e.g. job cancelled)
    and messages not always useful
* Zoom/Loupe tool in the fullsize view (on the backend, make image loading
    more readily interruptable and pre-load draft images as necessary for speed)
* Overhaul thumbnail support (e.g. allow user to store thumbs in custom
    cache location, support tumbler, use embedded image thumbnails and
    fallback to manual creation as necessary)
* Extend collection support
* Move settings tab to a tabbed dialog available from the toolbar
