Project todo list
=================

* DISCLAIMER: I expect this document will regularly get out of date.
* Nonetheless, the idea is to keep track of short-term plans (2-3 months).
* As stuff is completed or plans change the list should be updated.
* This file will be in source control to keep track of its history.

* Overhaul image class, metadata and image handling
   * track file attributes (file size, image dimensions, mtime, presence of thumbnails)
   * mimetype/store specific handler for metadata read/write and image processing

* Support for XMP sidecars (for images that don't support metadata read/write)

* Update the browser
    * be more consistent with user theme (colors, look and feel)
    * size and align text better
    * improve keyboard navigation

* Padding and alignment tweaks to most of the dialog areas

* Progress bar messages don't always disapper (e.g. job cancelled)
    and messages not always useful

* Zoom/Loupe tool in the fullsize view (on the backend, make image loading
    more readily interruptable and pre-load draft images as necessary for speed)

* Overhaul thumbnail support (e.g. allow user to store thumbs in custom
    cache location, support tumbler, use embedded image thumbnails and
    fallback to manual creation as necessary)

* Extend collection support to allow browsing of web-based stores
