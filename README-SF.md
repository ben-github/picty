picty - A photo collection manager
==================================

SourceForge Hosted Windows Releases of picty
---------------------------------------------

These are experimental releases of picty for windows. The software has not been thoroughly tested, so use at your own risk.

How to install
--------------

Download the file _picty-***************-setup.exe_, run it and follow the prompts. You can find the program in your start menu.

A note on filenames:
_picty-stable-v####-setup.exe_ - these are stable releases
_picty-testing-r####-setup.exe_ - these are unstable testing builds

Before you can run picty, you may also need the windows redistributable found at:
[http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=29](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=29)

What's Broken?
--------------

Compared to the linux version a few things are broken (I am working on fixes):

* Filesystem monitoring (i.e. if you change an image outside picty, you need
  to manually rescan to update the metadata in the program)

* Drag and drop to desktop does nothing (on Linux)

* Missing icons

* Occasional freezes/hangs
