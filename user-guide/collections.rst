Collections
===========

In picty, a collection can be a:

    * Local Store: The images in a directory and its sub-directories that
      you access repeatedly. This is the collection type that most users
      will use to manage their collection on their local disks.

    * Temporary Directory: You can use picty to temporarily browse a folder of images
      wihout creating a local store.

    * Device: The images on a camera, smartphone, memory card or other
      pluggable device. picty automatically tracks these devices are they
      are added and remove from the system.

    * (experimental) Web Service: The images hosted on a web service such as flickr

picty will keep the collection in sync with the underlying images. By default, each
time you open a collection picty will look for new, changed and deleted images
update in the source and the collection accordingly. (If the service is not online,
e.g. a webs service when you are not connected to the internet, you will be able to
browse the cached version of the collection.)
